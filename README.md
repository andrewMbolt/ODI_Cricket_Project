# ODI_Cricket_Project
Analysing data from ODI cricket matches

In this project I import data from cricsheet.com and clean it. 

score_predictor_part1 and score_predictor_part2 are projects to predict the number of runs a team will score, and whether the team batting second will reach this target respectively. Due to limits in the data these predictors operate unbiasedly - which is to say that they only use general information, rather than analysing players within a team or a teams performance in general.
